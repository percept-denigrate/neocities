## *Funny Games*

This movie is just pure crystallized violence. It presents the story of a typical, even stereotypical, american family spending a weekend in a vacation house. Two young, very creepy, and extremely white kids show up—and everything spirals down from here.

The movie is very *meta* and frequently breaks the fourth wall. It is a satire of the depiction of violence in american cinema. Which is why the director first intented to make the movie in english with american actors.
