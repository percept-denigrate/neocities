## *Funny Games*

![](funny_games.png)

This movie is just pure crystallized violence. It presents the story of a typical, even stereotypical, american family spending a weekend in their vacation house. Two young, very creepy, and extremely white kids show up—and everything spirals down from here.

A pervasive sense of unease is present in the movie from the very moment the antagonists appear. Everything feels *off*, the escalation of violence happens in an unnatural way. The protagonists are completely powerless and passive, to the point where they are basically just props.

The movie is very *meta* and frequently breaks the fourth wall. It is a satire of the depiction of violence in american cinema. Which is why the director first intented to make the movie in english with american actors. Everyone who has seen the movie will remember the remote control scene.
