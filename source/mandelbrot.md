% Mandelbrot set

The Mandelbrot set is probably the most famous matheatical fractal figure. It defined by all complex numbers *c* such that the sequence defined by *z_0* = 0 and *z_n+1* = *z_n*^2 + *c* converges.

[My gf](https://digital-interpolation.neocities.org/) and I are painting it. We use a piece of carboard with a folding piece panel on either side. We are drawing the main figure with a blue gradient background on the main panel, and we will draw zoomed in perspectives with a magenta gradient background on the side panels.
